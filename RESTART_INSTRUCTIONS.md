# 🔄 Restart Instructions for Optimized Backend

## The Problem
The backend was receiving audio chunks but not processing them because the background task wasn't consuming from the queue properly.

## What Was Fixed
1. ✅ Added detailed logging to track queue operations
2. ✅ Added error handling for transcription failures
3. ✅ Added queue size monitoring
4. ✅ Added task creation logging
5. ✅ Better exception handling throughout

## How to Restart

### Step 1: Stop Current Backend
In your backend terminal, press `Ctrl+C`

### Step 2: Start Optimized Backend
```bash
cd d:\store\notify\backend
python optimized_main.py
```

### Step 3: Refresh Frontend
In your browser:
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` (hard refresh)
- Or close and reopen the tab

### Step 4: Test
1. Create a new lecture
2. Start recording
3. Speak for 60+ seconds

## What You Should See Now

### Backend Logs (Every chunk):
```
INFO:__main__:📥 Received audio chunk for lecture-X: 641750 bytes
INFO:__main__:📊 Queue size for lecture-X: 1
INFO:__main__:⏳ Waiting for audio chunk in queue for lecture-X...
INFO:__main__:✅ Got audio chunk from queue for lecture-X
INFO:__main__:🎤 Transcribing: chunk_lecture-X_xxx.wav
INFO:__main__:✅ Transcription complete: Neural networks are...
INFO:__main__:📝 Transcription 1: Neural networks are...
```

### Backend Logs (At 60 seconds):
```
INFO:__main__:⏰ 60 seconds elapsed, triggering synthesis
INFO:__main__:🤖 Starting agentic synthesis for lecture-X
INFO:__main__:📝 Structured notes generated and sent
```

### Frontend Console:
```javascript
Received WebSocket message: { type: "transcription", content: "..." }
✅ Transcription 1 complete

Received WebSocket message: { type: "synthesis_started" }
🤖 Synthesis started

Received WebSocket message: { type: "structured_notes", content: "..." }
📚 Structured notes received
```

### Frontend UI:
- **Blue boxes** with transcriptions appear every 20s
- **Gradient cards** with structured notes appear at 60s

## If Still Not Working

### Check 1: Task Creation
Look for this in logs:
```
INFO:__main__:🚀 Creating background processing task for lecture-X
INFO:__main__:✅ Background task created and started for lecture-X
```

### Check 2: Queue Processing
Look for this in logs:
```
INFO:__main__:⏳ Waiting for audio chunk in queue...
INFO:__main__:✅ Got audio chunk from queue
```

If you see "Waiting" but never "Got", the task is blocked.

### Check 3: Transcription
Look for this in logs:
```
INFO:__main__:🎤 Transcribing: chunk_xxx.wav
INFO:__main__:✅ Transcription complete: ...
```

If you see errors here, check Whisper installation.

## Debug Commands

### Check if backend is running:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8001/
```

### Check WebSocket connection:
```bash
# In browser console
ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8001/ws/lecture/test-123')
ws.onmessage = (e) => console.log(JSON.parse(e.data))
```

## Common Issues

### Issue: "No active WebSocket connection"
**Solution**: Make sure WebSocket connects BEFORE sending audio

### Issue: Queue fills up but nothing processes
**Solution**: Check for exceptions in transcription (Whisper errors)

### Issue: Transcriptions work but no synthesis
**Solution**: Check GROQ_API_KEY is set correctly

**After restarting with these fixes, the system should work perfectly!** 🚀
